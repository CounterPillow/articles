        <p>This repository is filled with articles I've written and needed online for various reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>applicative_monad.md</strong> is the original text of the 2013 Applicative-Monad proposal, which finally got things going to make Applicative a superclass of Monad.</li>
<li>
<strong>build.md</strong> explains how the <code>build</code> function, which is used in rewrite rules for list-based functions, works.</li>
<li>
<strong>cont_monad.md</strong> is my shot at explaining the <code>Cont</code> Monad.</li>
<li>
<strong>crazy_io.md</strong> shows some examples of lazy IO pitfalls in Haskell.</li>
<li>
<strong>fbut.md</strong> is a list of <strong>F</strong>requently <strong>B</strong>rought <strong>U</strong>p <strong>T</strong>opics in #haskell for easy reference. It's like an FAQ, except that the "F" stands for "frequently" instead of "someone thought this may be worth mentioning".</li>
<li>
<strong>great_things_about_haskell.md</strong> explains what I thought was cool about Haskell some time ago. Maybe I should update it some day.</li>
<li>
<strong>install_haskell_platform_manually.md</strong> was once a small file for myself to walk me through setting up GHC properly in case I needed to. The revised version is this file, explaining how to get from zero to GHC and Haskell Platform.</li>
<li>
<strong>law-rules.md</strong> is a draft of a not-yet-proposed proposal for a GHC feature.</li>
<li>
<strong>loeb-moeb.md</strong> is about an interesting function that calculates the result of a function when applied to the result of the function.</li>
<li>
<strong>modular_keyboard.md</strong> describes a keyboard I'd like to have. I encourage everyone to steal this idea so I can buy one from him.</li>
<li>
<strong>reader_instance_derived.md</strong> shows step by step how the golfed instance of Reader (as presented in LYAH, for example) can be derived from something sensible and readable.</li>
<li>
<strong>useful_techniques.md</strong> shows some neat little Haskell tricks I've collected.</li>
<li>
<strong>write_yourself_a_brainfuck.md</strong> is a tutorial on how to write a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> interpreter in Haskell. It also includes enough exercises to keep readers busy.</li>
