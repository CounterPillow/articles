{"name":"Articles","tagline":"Miscellaneous articles, mostly Haskell related.","body":"This repository is filled with articles I've written and needed online for various reasons.\r\n\r\n- **applicative_monad.md** is the original text of the 2013 Applicative-Monad proposal, which finally got things going to make Applicative a superclass of Monad.\r\n- **build.md** explains how the `build` function, which is used in rewrite rules for list-based functions, works.\r\n- **cont_monad.md** is my shot at explaining the `Cont` Monad.\r\n- **crazy_io.md** shows some examples of lazy IO pitfalls in Haskell.\r\n- **fbut.md** is a list of **F**requently **B**rought **U**p **T**opics in #haskell for easy reference. It's like an FAQ, except that the \"F\" stands for \"frequently\" instead of \"someone thought this may be worth mentioning\".\r\n- **great_things_about_haskell.md** explains what I thought was cool about Haskell some time ago. Maybe I should update it some day.\r\n- **install_haskell_platform_manually.md** was once a small file for myself to walk me through setting up GHC properly in case I needed to. The revised version is this file, explaining how to get from zero to GHC and Haskell Platform.\r\n- **law-rules.md** is a draft of a not-yet-proposed proposal for a GHC feature.\r\n- **loeb-moeb.md** is about an interesting function that calculates the result of a function when applied to the result of the function.\r\n- **modular_keyboard.md** describes a keyboard I'd like to have. I encourage everyone to steal this idea so I can buy one from him.\r\n- **reader_instance_derived.md** shows step by step how the golfed instance of Reader (as presented in LYAH, for example) can be derived from something sensible and readable.\r\n- **useful_techniques.md** shows some neat little Haskell tricks I've collected.\r\n- **write_yourself_a_brainfuck.md** is a tutorial on how to write a basic [Brainfuck][bf] interpreter in Haskell. It also includes enough exercises to keep readers busy.\r\n\r\n[bf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
